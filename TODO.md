# MattyLang Road Map

- v0.1
	- Chunks
	- Block-scoped variables (Definition, Assignment)
	- Primitives literals and types (Nil, Bool, Real, String)
	- Unary and binary expressions (arithmetic, relational, logical).
- v0.2
	- Control flow statements (If, While, Break, Continue)
- v0.3
	- Functions and function types (Definition, Call, Return statements)
	- Intrinsic functions (replaced once a standard library is introduced)
- v1.0
	- Code Improvements
	- Documentation	Improvements
	- Tests
- Future Plans (subject to change)
	- Module imports/exports
	- Compound types and tuples
	- MattyLang runtime, and have the emitter generate bytecode
	- MattyLang standard library
	- Function declarations (to allow for mutual recursion)
	- Closures and lambdas
	- Integer type, literals, and bitwise operations
	- Arrays and subscript expression
	- Real literal expansion (scientific notation)
	- String literal expansion (string escape sequences, string interpolation)
	- ...
